START:
1. LOAD THE SHEET INTO POWER BI

2. DATA CLEANING:
	ITEM FAT CONTENT -> REPLACE TO STANDARD VALUES
	ITEMS WEIGHT HAVE 16% NULLS BUT WE ARE NOT GOING TO HANDLE IT

3.  START WORKING WITH DASHBOARD
	CANVA SETTINGS -> TYPE = CUSTOM, HEIGHT = 800 PX, WIDTH = 1400 PX, VERTICAL ALIGNMENT = MIDDLE
	CANVAS BG -> COLOR = WHITE, TRANSPARENCY = 40%

4. INSERT SHAPE -> ROUNDED TOP -> SHAPE SETTING -> ROTATION 90 DEGREE
	GENERAL PROPERTY -> HEIGHT = 750 WIDTH = 240
	SHAPE PROPERTY -> SHAPE -> ROUNDED TOP CORNER = 20%
	SHAPE PROPERTY -> STYLE -> COLOR -> #FFD200 -> BORDER = OFF -> SHADOW = ON

5. INSERT TEXTBOX -> TYPE BLINKIT, SIZE 36 -> SEGOE (BOLD) -> GENERAL PROPERTY -> BG = OFF -> SELECT IT = FONT COLOR = GREEN

6. KPI : DAX FOR TOTAL SALES, AVERAGE SALES, NO OF ITEMS = COUNTROWS(), AVERAGE RATING

7. VISUALS -> CARD(NEW) -> SELECT KPI'S -> VISUAL PROPERTY -> LAYOUT -> ARRANGEMENT = GRID, MAX ROW AND MAX COLS = 2,
SPACE BETWEEN CARS = 0 PX
VISUAL PROPERTY -> CALLOUT VALUES -> FONT = SEGEO UI BOLD, 21, HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT = LEFT
VISUAL PROPERTY -> LABEL -> FONT = SEGEO SEMI BOLD, POSITION = BELOW VALUE
GENERAL PROPERTY -> PROPERTY -> SIZE -> HEIGHT = 270, WIDTH = 570
VISUALIZATION -> ADD DATA ICON -> RENAME ALL KPI'S TO CAPITAL
VISUAL PROPERTY -> CALLOUT VALUES -> LAYOUT = CENTER
VISUAL PROPERTY -> CARD -> SHADOW = ON, SHAPE = ROUNDED RECTANGLE, ROUNDED CORNER = 10PX, PADDING = WIDE,
BG-> TRANSPARENCY = 40%
ACCENT BAR = ON, WIDTH = 5PX, COLOR = DARK GREEN

SIMILARLY SELECT ALL OTHER KPI IMAGES

9. START TO BUILD CHART REQUIREMENTS
	INSERT A ROUNDED RECTANGLE HEIGHT = 500, WIDTH = 560
	SHAPE -> ROUNDED CORNERS = 3%
	STYLE -> COLOR = WHITE, BORDER = ON, SHADOW = ON
9.1 CREATE A DONUT CHART LEGEND = FAT CONTENT, VALUES = SALES
	CLICK MODELING -> NEW PARAMETER -> FEILDS ->NAME IT AS METRICS -> ADD KPI MEASURES -> CREATE
	FORMAT SLICER SETTING -> TILE, SELECTION -> SIGNLE SELECT, GENERAL PROPERTY -> PROPERTY -> HEIGHT = 40, WIDTH = 460

DONUT CHART SETTING -> LEGEND = POSITION TOP LEFT, TITLE OFF

ADD NEW CARD -> DRAG TOTAL SALES -> CALLOUT VALS -> HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT
