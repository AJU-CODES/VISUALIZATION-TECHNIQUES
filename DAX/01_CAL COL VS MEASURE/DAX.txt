DAX is a library of functions and operators combined to build formulas and
expressions. 

Also known as Function Language, where the full code is kept inside a function.

CALCULATED COLUMNS:

* Expands table by creating new column
* Stored along with table, Consumes Memory
* Less analytical capability
* It refers a column

Eg: New Prod = [Product Item] &" - "&[Product Category]
    Profit = [Sales Amount] - [Cost Amount]

MEASURE:

* Summarizes data into a single value
* Calculate at runtime
* Rich analytical capability
* It refers a value

Eg: Total Profit = Sum([Sales Amount]) - Sum([Cost Amount])
    
Creating Calculated column and measure

Load **DATA** 

We need to combine product name and category name

Click on Data Sheet -> NEW COLUMN -> Product FullName = Data[Product name] &" - "& Data[Product Category]

Apply the above formula

For Measure

Total Sales = SUM(Data[Sales Amount])

Eg:

Profit Calcol = Data[Sales Amount] - Data[Cost Amount]

ProfitMeasure = SUM(Data[Sales Amount]) - SUM(Data[Cost Amount]) 

Prev Yr Sale = CALCULATE(SUM(Data[Sales Amount]),SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Data[Sale date].[Date]))
