* IMPORT ALL THE DATA ONE BY ONE

* EXPLORE THE TABLE VIEW

%% BEFORE ENTERING INTO DATA MODELING ;CLEAN THE DATASET FIRST

* DELIVERY STATUS DATASET HAVE SOME 'BLANK' VALUES

* LETS SEE THE MODEL VIEW AND EXPLORE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THEM

* DELETE ALL THE RELATIONSHIP EXCEPT CUSTOMERS_DATASET AND ORDERS DATASET

%% IF YOU WANT TO MAKE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COMMON COLS CHECK THEY HOLDS THE SAME 
DATATYPE

* HOW TO IDENTIFY THE FACT AND DIMENSION TABLE

* OPEN POWER QUERY EDITOR -> VIEW RIBBON -> COLUMNS DISTRIBUTION

CHECK THE DISTINCT AND UNIQUE
EG: {A,B,A,C}: DISTINCT = A,B,C (3) ; UNIQUE = B,C (2) 

SO THAT YOU CAN IDENTIFY THE PRIMARY AND FOREIGN KEYS OF DIMENSION AND FACT

* AUTO RELATIONSHIP, DRAG AND DROP , MANAGE RELATIONSHIP ICON -> NEW REL

* ACTIVE AND INACTIVE RELATIONSHIP

* CREATE NEW TABLE Calendar Table = CALENDAR(MIN(orders_dataset[order_date]),MAX(orders_dataset[order_date]))

* MAKE REL BETWEEN Date and orders_dataset 's Order_date...
IF THERE IS A NEED TO MAKE CALCULATIONS BASED ON Ship_date;
MAKE AN INACTIVE REL BETWEEN DATE AND Ship_date .. 

%% WE USE 'USERELATIONSHIP'IN DAX TO MANIPULATE INACTIVE RELATIONSHIP
